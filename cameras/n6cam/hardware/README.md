# openmv_n6 hardware

The board runs bare; the case is the only design work.

## Case: [`case/`](case/) — 3-part printed case with a bq25185 solar charger and 1S LiPo

Moved in from `~/cad/openmv-n6-case` on 2026-09-03 (designed 2026-08-12, rev
B–D on 2026-09-02, rev E on 2026-09-12). Front cup, camera plate and back
cup, parametric build123d in `case/caselib.py` with one `*.step.py`
generator per part and `fitcheck.step.py` for the sectioned review
assembly; STEP/STL outputs and `snap-*.png` renders sit beside them.
Rev E carries the Adafruit 6091 bq25185 charger on the back of the plate,
a panel-mount DC barrel jack up through the bottom wall under it, and the
battery behind the charger; `case/check.py` is the fail-closed
interference check (static pairs + slide-in sweep). `case/ref/` holds the N6
board model (`openmv-n6.py` / `.step`, measured from OpenMV's GLB),
`DIMENSIONS.md`, and the charger's part facts (`bq25185-part.yaml`; the
vendor STEP itself is fetched with `sarg cad get`, not committed). Not
printed yet. Regenerate with the `cad` skill; review with `cad-viewer`.

## LoRa hat: [`lora_hat/`](lora_hat/) — planned 2026-09-13

`lora_hat/PLAN.md`: an SX1262 (Ebyte E22-900M22S) hat on the N6's 2×8
headers, driven over SPI2 from the MicroPython bundle (`meshcore.py`
group-text packets on the existing MeshCore mesh), inside the camera puck
with a flex antenna. tscircuit design, JLCPCB assembly. Nothing ordered yet;
gates in the plan's §8.

## History: how the enclosure was unblocked

**Update 2026-09-02: the mechanical data exists.** The N6 was measured from
OpenMV's own GLB models on 2026-08-12 (`~/cad/openmv-n6/DIMENSIONS.md`), and
a copy of both the dimension notes and the build123d reference model now
lives in the repo at
[`../../n6_speedcam/hardware/case/ref/`](../../n6_speedcam/hardware/case/ref/)
(`OPENMV_N6_DIMENSIONS.md`, `openmv_n6_ref.py`). The n6_speedcam case hangs
the N6 from its two Ø2.80 mounting holes; a plain N6-only case for this
directory can reuse that reference model and the same boss recipe. The rest
of this note is the pre-measurement state, kept for the list of what an
enclosure needs.

An enclosure matching the ESP32-S3 cases
([`../../esp32_s3_cam/hardware/case/`](../../esp32_s3_cam/hardware/case/)) is
wanted, but at the time of writing **there was no mechanical data for this board
in this repo or in sarg**. A full 128-part catalogue sweep found no OpenMV
board of any generation (N6, H7, RT1062) from any owner; OpenMV is not a
vendor in the catalogue at all. The 76 OpenMV notes are entirely firmware and
sensor behaviour, with nothing mechanical.

So this one starts from a caliper, not from a model. To unblock it, capture —
either from the vendor's published hardware files or by measurement:

- PCB outline L x W x thickness, corner radius
- mounting hole centres + diameter
- USB-C shell size, its centre offset from the board datum, protrusion past
  the PCB edge, and **which edge it is on** (that edge becomes the floor)
- tallest component above and below the PCB
- M12 lens barrel diameter, its axis position, and height above the PCB
- any connector that must stay reachable, and the SD slot position

Then the case is the same recipe as the ESP32-S3 pair: stand it on the
connector edge, ports down, tripod insert on the back, and reuse
`cameras/hardware_common/caseskit.py`.

Worth noting for whoever does it: a crashing build now rolls back and is
blacklisted on its own, but `cpufreq` and the CSI hang list (see the README)
still call for a first boot near USB, so keep the USB port reachable.

See [`../../pi5cam/hardware/`](../../pi5cam/hardware/) for the conventions
(design source in git, exports regenerated under `export/`).
